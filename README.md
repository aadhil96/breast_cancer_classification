## Breast cancer classification

The goal of the project is a medical data analysis using artificial intelligence methods such as machine learning and deep learning for classifying cancers (malignant or benign). Breast cancer is the most common cancer occurring among women, and this is also the main reason for dying from cancer in the world. The most effective way to reduce numbers of death is early detection.
Every 19 seconds, cancer in women is diagnosed somewhere in the world, and every 74 seconds someone dies from breast cancer.

The Breast Cancer Dataset is a dataset of features computed from breast mass of candidate patients. Each instance of features corresponds to a malignant or benign tumour. The motivation behind studying this dataset is the develop an algorithm, which would be able to predict whether a patient has a malignant or benign tumour, based on the features computed from her breast mass. I decided to use this dataset for my first blog post on machine learning, since its a very straightforward dataset with no missing values and all variables being real valued (no categorical variables).

* Number of attributes for each patient : 30
* Number of patients : 569
* Number of class labels : 2 ('B' and 'M' corresponding to 357 Benign and 212 Malignant patients)
